AppDynamics DEXTER
Turn your APM data store into Data Warehouse with advanced reporting, including entities, configuration, metrics, flowmaps, events, snapshots and call graph flame graphs

AppDynamics provides a rich source of information about your monitored applications, including the performance of individual business activities, dependency flow between application components, and details on every business transaction in an instrumented environment.
AppDynamics APM provides a rich toolkit for turning the vast corpus of data captured by AppDynamics into valuable insights.
AppDynamics DEXTER (Data Extraction and Enhanced Reporting) can make this process even faster and simpler. DEXTER provides new ways to unlock the data stored in the AppDynamics platform. You can analyze this information in a number of data warehousing and visualization applications, and combine it with your own data to generate customized reports.
